# Junior Java Developer Skills Assessment - Solutions

This project demonstrates core Java skills through a set of simple programs. Below is a summary of each file and its purpose:

---

## 1. `UserInfo.java`
A basic program that prompts the user for their name and age, and displays a greeting. Demonstrates use of `Scanner` for input and simple output.

## 2. `PayrollCalculator.java`
Calculates the payroll for a list of employees using arrays. Demonstrates arrays, loops, and basic math operations.

## 3. `GradeManager.java`
Accepts student grades and calculates average, min, and max. Uses arrays, loops, and if-statements.

## 4. `ShoppingCart.java`
Simulates a shopping cart. Demonstrates array manipulation and total price calculation.

## 5. `TextProcessor.java`
Performs string manipulations like converting to uppercase and replacing characters. Demonstrates string operations and loops.

## 6. `Book.java`, `Textbook.java`, `Library.java`
Demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- `Book` is a base class.
- `Textbook` extends `Book`.
- `Library` creates and prints books using inheritance.

## 7. `VisitorCounter.java`
Shows use of static variables to count how many objects (visitors) are created.

## 8. `PatternMaker.java`
Generates simple text-based patterns using nested loops. (To be added if needed.)

## Notes
Each file is located inside the `src/` folder and has been compiled and tested.  
Version control was managed using `git`, and each feature was pushed through branches for clarity.
